## Fixes

- **Fix search not showing any results when typing**
- Fix double query sending
- Make gitignore syntax help text fit window width

## Improvements

- Show summon hotkey on the indexing screen
- Pause indexing on low battery (`< 30%`)
- Show when Full Disk Access is not granted

## Features

- Add **Copy paths** and **Copy filenames** to the right click menu
- Add *Faster search, with less optimal results* option
- Add *Keep window open when the app is in background* option
- Add **Exclude from index** option to the right click menu
- Add Quit button
- Add default scripts to serve as examples:
    - `Copy to temporary folder`
    - `Archive`
    - `List archive contents` (this one exemplifies how to limit the extensions on which the script appears and how to show output)
